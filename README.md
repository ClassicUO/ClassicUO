# Introduction
ClassicUO is an open source implementation of the Ultima Online Classic Client. This client is intended to emulate all standard client versions and is primarily tested against Ultima Online free shards.

The client is currently under heavy development but is functional. The code is based on the [FNA-XNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/) framework. C# is chosen because there is a large community of developers working on Ultima Online server emulators in C#, because FNA-XNA exists and seems reasonably suitable for creating this type of game.

ClassicUO is natively cross platform and supports:
* Windows [DirectX 11, OpenGL, Vulkan]
* Linux   [OpenGL, Vulkan]
* macOS   [Metal, OpenGL, MoltenVK]

# How to build the project

Clone repository with:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO.git
```

### Windows
The binary produced will work on all supported platforms.

You'll need [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). The free community edition should be fine. Once that
is installed:

- Open ClassicUO.sln from the root of the repository.

- Select "Debug" or "Release" at the top.

- Hit F5 to build. The output will be in the "bin/Release" or "bin/Debug" directory.

# Linux

- Open a terminal and enter the following commands.

## Ubuntu

sudo apt update
sudo apt install dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common lsb-release
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF
```

```
sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/ubuntu stable-`lsb_release -sc` main"
```

- Navigate to ClassicUO scripts folder:
  `cd /your/path/to/ClassicUO/scripts`

- Execute `build.sh` script. If you want build a debug version of ClassicUO just pass "debug" as argument like: `./build.sh debug`.
  Probably you have to set the `build.sh` file executable with with the command `chmod -x build.sh`

- Navigate to `/your/path/to/ClassicUO/bin/[Debug or Release]`


### macOS
All the commands should be executed in terminal. All global package installs should be done only if not yet installed.

- Install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS (if not yet installed):
  Follow instructions on https://brew.sh/

- Install Mono (https://www.mono-project.com/):
  `brew install mono`

- Install NuGet, a package manager for .NET (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/):
  `brew install nuget`

- Navigate to ClassicUO root folder:
  `cd /your/path/to/ClassicUO`

- Restore packages (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-restore):
  `nuget restore`

- Build:
  - Debug version: `msbuild /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug`
  - Release version: `msbuild /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release`

- Run ClassicUO via Mono:
  - Debug version: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=./bin/Debug/osx/ mono ./bin/Debug/ClassicUO.exe`
  - Release version: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=./bin/Release/osx/ mono ./bin/Release/ClassicUO.exe`

After the first run, ignore the error message and a new file called `settings.json` will be automatically created in the directory that contains ClassicUO.exe.

Other useful commands:
- `msbuild /t:Clean /p:Configuration=Debug`
- `msbuild /t:Clean /p:Configuration=Release`
