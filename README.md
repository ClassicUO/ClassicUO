# Introduction
ClassicUO is an open source implementation of the Ultima Online Classic Client. This client is intended to emulate all standard client versions and is primarily tested against Ultima Online free shards.

The client is currently under heavy development but is functional. The code is based on the [FNA-XNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/) framework. C# is chosen because there is a large community of developers working on Ultima Online server emulators in C#, because FNA-XNA exists and seems reasonably suitable for creating this type of game.

ClassicUO is natively cross platform and supports:
* Windows [DirectX 11 or OpenGL]
* Linux   [OpenGL]
* macOS   [Metal or OpenGL]

# How to build the project
### Windows
The binary produced will work on all supported platforms.

You'll need [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). The free community edition should be fine. Once that
is installed:

1. Open ClassicUO.sln in the root of the repository.

2. Select "Debug" or "Release" at the top.

3. Hit F5 to build. The output will be in the "bin/Release" or "bin/Debug" directory.

### Linux
Open a terminal instance and put the following commands:

1. `sudo apt-get install mono-complete`

2. `sudo apt-get install monodevelop`

3. Select "Debug" or "Release" at the top.

4. Hit F5 to build. The output will be in the "bin/Release" or "bin/Debug" directory.

### macOS
All the commands should be executed in terminal. All global package installs should be done only if not yet installed.

1. Install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS (if not yet installed):
Follow instructions on https://brew.sh/

2. Install Mono (https://www.mono-project.com/):
`brew install mono`

3. Install NuGet, a package manager for .NET (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/):
`brew install nuget`

4. Navigate to ClassicUO root folder:
`cd /your/path/to/ClassicUO`

5. Restore packages (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-restore):
`nuget restore`

6. Build:
  - Debug version: `msbuild /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug`
  - Release version: `msbuild /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release`

7. Run ClassicUO via Mono:
  - Debug version: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=./bin/Debug/osx/ mono ./bin/Debug/ClassicUO.exe`
  - Release version: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=./bin/Release/osx/ mono ./bin/Release/ClassicUO.exe`

After the first run, ignore the error message and a new file called `settings.json` will be automatically created in the directory that contains ClassicUO.exe.

Other useful commands:
- `msbuild /t:Clean /p:Configuration=Debug`
- `msbuild /t:Clean /p:Configuration=Release`
